## ðŸ¤¸ Usage

A typical usage involves adding job step using `softprops/diffset@master`

This will collect a list of files that have changed and export them to an output named `files`

```diff
name: Main

on: push

jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
+     - name: Diffset
+       id: diffset
+       uses: softprops/diffset@master
+       env:
+         GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Print Diffset
        run: echo "Files changed were ${{ steps.diffset.outputs.files }}"
```

### ðŸ’… Customizing

#### inputs

The following are optional as `step.with` keys

This action supports dynamically named inputs which will result in dynamically named outputs.
Specifically this uses any inputs with a suffix of `_files`

| Name        | Type    | Description                                                     |

| `*_files`   | string  | A file pattern to filter changed files                          |


#### outputs

The following outputs can be accessed via `${{ steps.<step-id>.outputs }}` from this action

|-------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `*_files`   | string  | A space delimited list of files that changed that matched an input pattern |
